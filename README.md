## üß© Sidebar Toggle Functionality

This settings page includes a **toggle switch** that controls the behavior of the sidebar:

- **Single Click on the Toggle Switch**: The sidebar minimizes, and only the **icons** are visible. This compact view is perfect for users who want more screen space for the main content.
  
- **Double Click on the Toggle Switch**: The sidebar returns to its **expanded view**, displaying both icons and text labels for each item.

This interactive feature is built using **JavaScript** and enhances the user experience by allowing them to control how much information they want to see.

- Responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- Toggle switch
